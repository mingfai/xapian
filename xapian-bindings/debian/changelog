    releases.
  * debian/ruby-xapian.preinst: Drop cleanup for upgrade failure from 1.2.15-4

xapian-bindings (1.2.17-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Check debian/bindings-to-packages for a list of bindings to package, to
    allow people to easily build subsets of the binary packages.
  * Always regenerate debian/control on "debian/rules maint" as the
    dependencies are complex and the work to regenerate is minor.
  * Where available, use ruby-all-dev and ruby-all as BDs and use
    ruby_debian_dev.rb to determine the ruby versions to build for.

  * debian/rules: Update for upcoming changes in Tcl/Tk (based on patch from
    Sergei Golovan).  (Closes: #724830)
  * Build ruby bindings for ruby2.0 as well - requires passing RUBY_INC_ARCH
    to configure until upstream updates configure for ruby2.0.

    .tar.xz which upstream now uses.

    + Includes fixes for #625679 and Ruby Dir.mktmpdir() issue, so drop
      patches for these.
  * debian/rules: Use single quotes for substituting into debian/control.in to
    stop the shell from attempting to expand ${python:Versions}.
  * debian/rules: Use build-stamp and configure-stamp in the top level rather
    than in the debian subdirectory - this is consistent with where other
    packages put these files, and means dh_clean removes them for us
    automatically.
  * debian/rules: Add build-arch and build-indep targets.

xapian-bindings (1.2.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use dh_python2 instead of pycentral for Debian >= squeeze and Ubuntu >=
    natty.  (Closes: #617149)
  * python/pythontest2.py: With Python 2.7, gc.collect() doesn't always
    collect all the garbage, so repeat until no further objects are
    freed.  (Closes: #625679)
  * ruby/smoketest.rb: Older Ruby 1.8.x doesn't have Dir.mktmpdir() -
    just skip the compaction tests for these versions.
  * debian/rules: Don't force building against tcl 8.5 in experimental - that
    was just for the transition to tcl 8.5 being the default.

  * Update to require dh7 and use dh compact level 7.
  * Switch to dpkg-source 3.0 (quilt) format.
  * Drop unused build-dependency on po-debconf.

xapian-bindings (1.1.5-1) experimental; urgency=low

    dapper.
  * debian/python-xapian.install: The xapian packages are now generated in a
    subdirectory, so update the paths accordingly, and include the .pth file.
  * debian/rules: Do all building under debian/build so we can clean up with a
    single call to "rm -rf".
  * debian/rules,debian/control.in,debian/control-ruby.in: Build packages for
    Ruby 1.9.1 where appropriate.
  * debian/rules: Run autoreconf to pick up Debian's patched libtool.
  * Drop conflicts on versioned python packages (e.g. python2.4-xapian) as
    these packages were phased out before etch.

  * debian/rules: Update licence boilerplate from GPLv2+ to MIT/X.
  * debian/etc-php-conf.d-xapian.ini: Use ';' for comment instead of '#' as
    PHP 5.3 deprecates the latter.

    with upstream use.
  * debian/rules: Enable php5 bindings for hurd-i386 as php5 has now built
    there.
  * debian/rules: Include DH_PYCENTRAL=include-links change from Ubuntu - this
    means that the package is immediately useful when installed or upgraded.
    The downside is that the package needs a rebuild when the list of Python
    versions changes, but that's much less frequent than new Xapian packages.
  * debian/control.in: Update required debhelper version for Debian sarge and
    Ubuntu dapper.

    /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL -> /usr/share/licenses/GPL-2 since the
    former is now a symlink to GPL-3 and Xapian is GPL v2 or later.
  * debian/python-xapian.install: Look for files to install in "*-packages"
    instead of "site-packages" as Ubuntu jaunty's Python 2.6 installs packaged

xapian-bindings (1.0.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/copyright: Update for 2008 and a few other minor changes.
  * debian/rules: The dependency on libxapianN is now versioned.  We require a
    version >= the version of xapian-bindings being packaged (which is
    sometimes slightly too conservative, but simple to implement without
    manual maintenance).  Closes: #462106
  * debian/rules: Add support for parallel=<n> in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS, as
    recommended by policy 3.8.0.  Use $(filter ...) instead of $(find ...)
    to check for noopt in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS to avoid false matches on
    substrings of non-standard options (e.g. snooptables).  Add support
    for nocheck in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.
  * debian/control.in: Standards-Version: 3.8.0
  * debian/watch: Add watch file.  Not useful for me as I make the upstream
    releases, but DEHS, etc find it useful.
  * debian/control.in: Capitalise python to placate lintian.
  * debian/patch: Remove since all patches are already in the upstream
    sources.
  * debian/rules: Calculate the version starting the next release branch (so
    1.1.0 currently) and use that as the upper bound on the libxapian-dev
    build dependency).
  * debian/tclxapian.install: Update to reflect new install location which
    reflects the new tcl policy: /usr/lib/xapian<version> ->
    /usr/lib/tcltk/xapian<version>
  * debian/rules: Tweak how we build the conflicts/replaces for old
    python-xapian as the old way doesn't seem to work for newer versions of
    GNU make.
  * debian/rules: Force link_all_deplibs=no so libtool doesn't try to
    explicitly link with -lz.

  * debian/libxapian-ruby1.8.install: Package the installed RDocs.
  * debian/control.in,debian/control-php.in: The "Homepage:" header is now
    official, so convert "Homepage:" pseudo-headers.
  * debian/rules: For Debian lenny and later, and Ubuntu hardy and later,
    make use of the new tcl and tcl-dev packages as the Debian Tcl/Tk policy
    describes.

xapian-bindings (1.0.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    + "make clean" now removes python/testsuite.pyc.  Closes: #442766
  * debian/rules: Override RUBY_LIB and RUBY_LIB_ARCH which now have different
    defaults upstream.
  * debian/patch: Backport configure fix from upstream SVN to allow tcl8 to be
    built on unstable.
  * debian/tclxapian.install: Also package "usr/share/tcltk/xapian*" which is
    where files get installed on unstable.
  * debian/php4-xapian.install,debian/php5-xapian.install,
    debian/python-xapian.install,debian/libxapian-ruby1.8.install,
    debian/tclxapian.install: Update for "bindings.html" -> "index.html"
    change.

xapian-bindings (1.0.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/rules: Upstream build now installs xapian.php, so remove code to
    install it here.

 -- Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>  Thu,  5 Jul 2007 01:17:29 +0100

xapian-bindings (1.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * php4-xapian and php5-xapian now make use of the (relatively) new
    /etc/phpN/conf.d mechanism to enable the xapian extension automatically,
    instead of modifying php.ini directly (after checking that's OK using
    debconf).  Backports to Debian oldstable, and to Ubuntu etch and earlier,
    now require the user to add "extension=xapian.so" to php.ini by hand,
    so backports where this is required now include a README.Debian which
    explains this.
  * debian/rules: Upstream build now generates .pyo so we need to tell
    dh_install that we don't want to package it.

 -- Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>  Tue, 12 Jun 2007 02:21:14 +0100

xapian-bindings (1.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * New debconf translations:
    - Malayalam.  Closes: #418032
    - Dutch.  Closes: #423066
  * debian/rules: Debian unstable has dropped PHP4 support, so don't build
    php4-xapian for it.  Closes: #424809
  * debian/rules,debian/php4-xapian.install,debian/php5-install: Install and
    package xapian.php which is handy for PHP4 and vital for PHP5.
  * debian/rules: Update now there's a new stable release.  Keep support for
    oldstable for the time being, in case someone wants to backport.
  * debian/patch: Changes included upstream so remove.
  * debian/patch: Add new patches to fix "package require xapian" issues for
    Tcl example scripts.
  * debian/copyright: Update.
  * debian/rules: We don't need to pass --mandir or --infodir to configure
    as the values we explicitly set are the defaults anyway (and we don't
    have any documentation in "info" format).
  * debian/rules: Avoid Lintian's uses-dh-python-with-no-pycompat warning -
    for now we want to keep the call to dh_python for backports.

xapian-bindings (0.9.9-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * ACK NMU - thanks Christian!
  * debian/rules: Fix how we determine the phpapi version to depend on.
    The previous way was technically wrong, but got the right answer
    for Debian unstable, and for Ubuntu dapper and edgy (Debian sarge was
    wrong though).
  * debian/po/nb.po: New debconf translation from Hans Fredrik Nordhaug
    (Closes: #414461).
  * debian/rules: Ubuntu feisty has dropped php4 support.

xapian-bindings (0.9.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/rules: Build tcl and ruby bindings in the same build tree to save
    a bit of diskspace and time during the build.
  * debian/rules: Fix the incorrect "Conflicts:" and "Replaces:" we generate
    for the old "per-version" Python packages (broken in 0.9.8-1).
  * debian/patch: Patch to fix building bindings for Python 2.5 on amd64
    (needed for the Ubuntu etch and any other Debian derived distros with
    Python 2.5).

 -- Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>  Fri, 10 Nov 2006 04:03:28 +0000

xapian-bindings (0.9.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/rules: Add no-op "binary-indep" target (Closes: #395761).
  * debian/rules: Don't try to build PHP bindings on hurd-i386 (PHP hasn't
    been ported, but Python, Tcl, and Ruby have).
  * debian/rules: Upstream no longer support Python 2.1 bindings so update
    comments regarding the Python versions supported by the sarge backport.
  * debian/control.in,debian/control-php.in: Add "Suggests: xapian-doc" since
    the xapian-core documentation is useful reading for people developing
    using xapian-bindings.
  * debian/rules: Use python-all-dev where we can.

 -- Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>  Sat,  4 Nov 2006 22:02:05 +0000

xapian-bindings (0.9.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control.in,debian/rules: Build dependency on libxapian-dev
    should be versioned (Closes: #392537).
  * debian/rules: Don't include Python 2.1 support in the stable backport
    since SWIG generates bad code for it at present.

 -- Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>  Thu, 12 Oct 2006 14:36:43 +0100

xapian-bindings (0.9.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/rules: Fix typo in configure invocation for Tcl so that we only
    build the Tcl bindings in that source tree.
  * debian/rules: Build-Depends on phpN-cli so that we can run "make check".
  * debian/po/: Added newly translated debconf messages for fr, cs, pt, sv
    (Closes: #380341, #382933, #383396, #387533).

 -- Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>  Wed, 11 Oct 2006 19:09:35 +0100

xapian-bindings (0.9.6-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/copyright: Add Java bindings copyrights and licences.
  * debian/rules: Run "make check" on each of the built bindings.  It's a very
    lightweight test but will at least ensure that the basics work.  It also
    serves to check the core library is working - xapian-core's own testsuite
    is probably too slow to justify devoting autobuilder time to.
  * debian/control.in,debian/control-php.in: Remove "designed to be" from the
    package description at Wookey's suggestion.

 -- Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>  Sun, 09 Jul 2006 01:31:02 +0100

xapian-bindings (0.9.6-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Since the python packaging change we no longer have any
    "Architecture: all" packages to build so remove the binary-indep target.
  * Fix prerm file comments which said "postinst".
  * debian/copyright: Update with a thorough list of copyrights and licences.

 -- Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>  Mon, 26 Jun 2006 16:16:37 +0100

xapian-bindings (0.9.6-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Tweak description and add "Homepage: http://www.xapian.org/".
  * tclxapian package wasn't depending on the tcl interpreter due to a typo
    in debian/rules.
  * libxapian-ruby1.8 package wasn't depending on the ruby interpreter due to
    a typo in debian/rules.
  * Update python packages to follow new python packaging policy.

 -- Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>  Fri, 16 Jun 2006 04:09:49 +0100

xapian-bindings (0.9.6-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * configure with --disable-depending-tracking to reduce build time and
    space requirements a little.
  * Fix debian/control generation not to leave a partial file if interrupted.
  * Add packages for the Ruby bindings, built for Ruby 1.8.

 -- Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>  Fri,  9 Jun 2006 02:33:10 +0100

xapian-bindings (0.9.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * "Standards-Version: 3.7.2" - no changes required.
  * Debian unstable no longer includes Python 2.1 or 2.2, so don't package
    Python bindings for them (backports can easily reenable them.)
  * Add packages for the TCL bindings (which should work with any Tcl version
    from 8.1 onwards.)
  * We no longer need to change the permissions of xapian.py and xapian.pyc
    as they are now set correctly by the upstream "make install".
  * Add "python" to "Build-Depends" so that dh_python works and also to
    workaround a broken configure test for PYTHON_PATHSEP which uses "python"
    instead of "$PYTHON" so PYTHON_PATHSEP is empty if there's no "python"
    in the path.

 -- Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>  Mon, 15 May 2006 21:11:41 +0100

xapian-bindings (0.9.5-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * PHP bindings packages now have the correct "Depends:" and are able to
    automatically modify php.ini upon installation (using debconf to ask if
    this should be done) and removal.
  * dh_python automatically generates the xapian-python->xapian-python2.X
    dependency for us, so remove the PYTHON_VERSION_MAIN mechanism (which
    wasn't actually being used anyway!)

 -- Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>  Wed, 12 Apr 2006 19:03:23 +0100

xapian-bindings (0.9.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added packages for PHP bindings (for both PHP4 and PHP5).

  * "Standards-Version: 3.6.2" - no changes required.
  * debian/copyright: Update FSF address and give download URL for releases
    instead of obsolete CVS location.
  * debian/rules: When generating debian/control, die if the python package
    isn't installed (since we require it to discover the default python
    version).
  * debian/rules: Simplify configure invocation by taking advantage of the
    change to handling of --with-XXX options in 0.9.3.
  * debian/rules: Increase DH_COMPAT from 3 to 4.
  * debian/TODO: No point planning to package guile right now!
  * debian/rules: Generate bindings package for Python 2.1.
  * New maintainer.
